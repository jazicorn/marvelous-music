## Research: Task 2 of 2

If it’s been a while since you’ve worked with API data, and/or you need any refreshers, here are some additional resources that may help get you going:
GitHub Resources

- https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github
- https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners
- https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github 

Feel free to go through these to help learn the system. We do require your pre-work submission to be in GitHub.
JS and API Fetch Resources

If you could use a little help with the API fetch portion. Feel free to utilize these resources as you work on your pre-work:

- https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-fetch-api/
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-the-javascript-fetch-api-to-get-data/
- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-api-calls-with-fetch/
- https://javascript.info/

API Documentation

Don’t forget to research the API documentation for your project so you understand how to use the API. Helpful things to ask yourself are: Do you need to sign up for a free account? Are you limited to how many API calls you can place in a day? What does the data look like that is returned from the call? Here are the links to the API options again:

- Open-Meteo – a weather API
- Spotify – a music API (requires a free Spotify account and use of an access token)
- Swapi.Tech – an API about Star Wars films
- Marvel – an API about the Marvel fandom
- ARTIC – an art API from the Art Institute of Chicago
- TheDogAPI or the TheCatAPI – APIs about (you guessed it!) Dogs or Cats
- SampleAPIs – an API for coffee lovers
