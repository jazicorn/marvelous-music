## Plan: Task 1 of 2

Your pre-work assignment is to build a site using one of the following public APIs. Pick a topic that is of most interest to you:

- Open-Meteo - a weather API
- Spotify - a music API (requires a free Spotify account and use of an access token)
- Swapi.Tech - an API about Star Wars films
- Marvel - an API about the Marvel fandom
- ARTIC - an art API from the Art Institute of Chicago
- TheDogAPI or the TheCatAPI - APIs about (you guessed it!) Dogs or Cats
- SampleAPIs - an API for coffee lovers

The finished project you build as your pre-work assignment should contain the minimum of all the following:

#### STRUCTURE:
1. A public GitHub repository containing your project
2. An HTML document for the page
3. A CSS document to style the HTML page
4. A JavaScript file that retrieves data from one of several public API sources to display the data on your HTML page
5. A README file that includes the instructions for running the webpage

#### CONTENT:
1. **Display the data for at least 2 of the models in the API**
    *Examples: If you choose the use the Weather API, use temperature and condition (rainy/sunny/etc) models. For the Star Wars API, use characters and film title models.*
2. **Include navigation from each modelâ€™s page to the other models that are displayed**
    *Example: If you choose to use the Weather API, be able to click between a page that shows temperatures and a page that shows conditions. For the Star Wars API, have a page that shows character information and a page that shows film information.*
3. **Issue new GET requests for the linked data to display in the linked pages.**

#### FUNCTIONALITY:
- Be sure that we can get the code to run without issues by following the instructions in the README file
- Be sure navigation between the different models behaves properly and is not slowed down by requesting more data than needs to be displayed
- Be sure your code is readable and well structured
- If including a user-interactive feature like a search field, be sure that you appropriately handle error cases
- Be thoughtful about what type of styling is used (example: font-sizes are not too small or large, colors are not too dark/light to be easily seen, etc.)

***Now that you know the requirements, start planning your site!***
